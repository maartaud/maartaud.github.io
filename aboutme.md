Hi, my name is Marcelo Souza, I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Oceanography, and I just finished a Ph.D. in Meteorology at the Federal University of Santa Maria, Brazil. I am an oceanographer who became passionate about what lies above. 

Under the supervision of Dr. Everson Dal Piva, my Ph.D. dissertation focused on the contribution of extratropical cyclones and their associated fronts on precipitation patterns over the Southern Hemisphere in present and future climates, using data from CMIP6 models, reanalysis, and observations. These systems are responsible for much of the severe weather conditions over the South and Southeast regions of Brazil, but when they're not causing trouble for people and life, they are beautiful.


My research interests include synoptic and mesoscale meteorology, extreme events, climate change, and numerical modeling.

On my days off, you can meet me among mountains, trails, and dust.
