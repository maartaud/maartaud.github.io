I will soon provide extratropical cyclone track data across the globe (1991-2020) generated by the TRACK algorithm (Hodges, 1995). This data allows the computation of a series of cyclone statistics and other analyses, as shown in the figure below.

<div style="text-align: justify"><i>The animation above shows the monthly climatological mean of the track density (number of cyclone tracks per 5Â° spherical cap per month) for the Southern Hemisphere.
It is very interesting how the distribution of tracks evolves into a distinct ring-like pattern around Antarctica during summer.</i></div>
